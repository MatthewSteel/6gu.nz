The long list:
 - better keyboard nav,
 - better formula display/input,
 - complex data structures :-(
 - storage
 - js interop,
 - collaboration,
 - dynamic sheet creation etc.
 - custom cell formatting incl charts.


Short-term:
 - Formula error-handling,
 - Cell error display

Possible next projects:
 - Browsing through data?
 - Making new sheets,
 - Drop-down boxes on top-level sheets to select them,


Some simple keyboard nav would do wonders.
 - One table is selected,
 - Arrow keys move the selection around when the box isn't focussed,
 - Enter selects the formula box,
 - Enter submits, escape cancels (and resets),
 - Do something reasonable with clicks.



Do we want a special "sheet" literal function to make structs?


Names in formulas are a bit screwy, aren't they?
  Yeah, names have stopped updating :-(((


Names in call args should be looked up on the target cell's sheet?


I think lookups are backwards
Bad-ref replacement doesn't look deep into calls/exprs etc.

Tables should probably always find their way into the order? "If they're not present, sever their links to their broken children and re-run"?
  Not quite that simple, I think. We're good for now, though.




Then:
 - Complex data types? That's hard, man...



What do things look like from top-level?

Compile sheets to functions ahead of time and store them in an object. That's easy enough.
What I'm most worried about is top-level stuff -- can we compile it and reuse it? Kinda -- if terms are removed, the tsort stays intact. If terms are inserted, the ordering need only change between the two points (and we can run things from that point on.) We can chunk the computation and it can be JITted just fine.

Boy a lot of stuff is going to get rewritten when we need to make this fast...
(For future partial recompute: When an edge is added, we're lucky -- we can do with a linear scan and just put it "as late as possible" into the computation DAG.)

Struct lookup is by name, I think.



Sub-table stuff:
 - Internal scrolling?
 - Display of complex data types:
  - Arrays,
  - Objects,
  - "Tables".


What about interop?
 - Later. "Compat import/export" etc.
What about ever collecting garbage?
 - Later. "Mark variables as in/out."
What about closures?
 - Will require special support. Doable though.



What's next after that? Ideas:
 - A proper formula box,
 - Thinking about laziness and/or conditional evaluation.
    - Maybe `if(n < 2, #[1], #[fib(n=n-1) + fib(n=n-2)]).value`
    - Might be too confusing. Want to see how it plays with tsort too.
